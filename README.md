It is due **May 2, 2016** by 11:59 PM local time. 

In this repository you will find four packet traces (pcap files) that can be read by the WireShark tool (among other tools). You will need to investigate these traces to answer the questions below. To get started you will want to understand how to use WireShark's filtering capabilities.

## Trace 1: HTTP
1. Give three websites (domain anme and IP addresses) visited from source IP address `192.168.0.100`.

1. Give three search queries and the domain of the site for each query made from source IP address `192.168.0.100`.


### Trace 2: FTP
FTP is the file transport protocol. There is a lot of information about it on the internet.
1. What is the user name and password used to connect to the FTP server?

1. List any (and all) files that were downloaded from the FTP server.

1. List the full path for two files (in different directories) on the FTP server that were NOT downloaded.


### Trace 3: Traceroute
`traceroute` is a tool used to determine the route between two IP addresses. You can find information about on the internet.
Wikipedia has a nice introduction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute.
